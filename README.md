=========

This is the very early stages of a tool for configuring a Linux (and possibly other) machine with standard packages and applications.  For want of a better explanation it is intended as a Scala tool providing a subset of the functionality of Puppet or Chef.

## Why another tool and why Scala?

This is very pragmatic.  Puppet and Chef have their own particular syntax and functionality and I have found that they both seem to be very hard to configure to do some things that appear, on the face of it, to be very simple things to do by other means.  I'm familiar with Java and Scala, and I don't need all the functionality of Puppet and Chef, but I do want a tool that I can use to do everything I need to do without spending hours trying to figure out how to do it.

## How do you use this and configure it?

Don't ask me, it's early days, come back later!
